Cmlabs Documentation
====================

The `cmlabs` package is designed to complete `computational mathematics labs <https://files.teachbase.ru/system/attachment/2073903/file/692ea302cb4d810fe1b45462f76e19b8.pdf>`_ so all of the functions are written for understanding, not speed. It provides a collection of tools for interpolation, numerical methods.
